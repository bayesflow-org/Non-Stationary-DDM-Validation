# Validation of a Non-Stationary Cognitive Models

This repository contains the data and code for running the experiments and reproducing all results reported in our paper "Validation and Comparison of Non-Stationary Cognitive Models: A Diffusion Model Application". Superstatistics are emerging as a flexible framework for incorporating such *non-stationary* dynamics into existing cognitive model classes. In this work, we provide the first experimental validation of superstatistics and formal comparison of four non-stationary diffusion decision models in a specifically designed perceptual decision-making task.

The code depends on the [BayesFlow](https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow) library, which implements the neural network architectures and training utilities.
